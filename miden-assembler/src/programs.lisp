;; Inefficiencies List
;; 1. We do 27 `loc-loadw' values, when we can get away with 21 in `rows-add-up'
;; 2. we could avoid `rows-add-up' by just duping the top word and doing
;;    column check there.
;; Trade Off Notes:
;; 1. We prefer live sudoku puzzles. Meaning we pay extra for false
;;    ones, as we always compute the full checks without returing early
;; Random Notes:
;; we can do this much more efficiently, however we need to rethink
;; our algorithm given our tools.  Namely we re-read many locations,
;; where we can instead just do computation faster. Like
;; `load-advice-into-locals' can serve as the read-column check
